## Fixed issues from the previous version:

- Fixed the built-in forms (with no popup). It's easy to make the Callme to get data from any of the forms on the page. Read the manual for further instructions
- You can get find out what link was clicked to view the callme form. So it's the new easy way to count conversions. Add a new attribute data-cme="your title" to any object with class .callme_viewform. That's how you'll know which link is the most popular.
- new yellow/black template
- other small fixes
